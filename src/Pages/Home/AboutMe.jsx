            I was born in India and moved to the United States when I was young. I speak three fluent languages: Hindi, Gujarati, and English. I began programming when I was a senior in high school and was interested in web development and software engineering, so I am taking coursework at University of Georgia. However, I am also interested in data science so currently, I am learning Python and data structures on my own.
